# ShopifyQL Skill for Claude Code

A Claude Code skill for writing, executing, debugging, and explaining ShopifyQL analytics queries and Shopify Segment Query Language customer filters.

## What it does

Triggers automatically when you ask Claude to:
- Write a ShopifyQL report query (`FROM sales SHOW ...`)
- **Run or execute a query against your live store**
- Build a customer segment filter
- Debug a ShopifyQL syntax error
- Translate a business question into a Shopify analytics query
- Understand available tables, dimensions, or metrics

## Covers

- **ShopifyQL** — full query structure, strict keyword ordering, all clauses (`WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, `TIMESERIES`, `HAVING`, `COMPARE TO`, `VISUALIZE`, `WITH` modifiers, semi-joins, math on metrics, `TOP N`)
- **Segment Query Language** — all attribute types, operators, date formats, and functions (`products_purchased`, `orders_placed`, `shopify_email`, `anniversary`, `customer_within_distance`, `storefront_event`)
- **Common ecommerce patterns** — top products, channel attribution, re-engagement, high-value customers, wholesale/B2B segments
- **Debugging checklist** — ordered list of the most common ShopifyQL errors

## Execution

This plugin can execute ShopifyQL queries directly against your Shopify store.

### Requirements

- Python 3.11: `brew install python@3.11`
- Dependencies: `pip3.11 install 'shopifyql[all]' pandas python-dotenv certifi`
- A Shopify Custom App with scopes: `read_analytics`, `read_reports`, `read_customers`, `read_orders`

### Setup

Credentials must be available as **OS environment variables** before launching Claude. The script reads them directly from the environment — it does not load `.env` files.

The easiest way is to export them in your shell profile (`~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc`):

```bash
export SHOPIFY_STORE_URL=my-store.myshopify.com
export SHOPIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN=shpat_xxxx
```

Or pass them inline when launching Claude:

```bash
SHOPIFY_STORE_URL=my-store.myshopify.com SHOPIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN=shpat_xxxx claude
```

For guided setup, run once per project:

```
/shopifyql-setup
```

### Usage

1. Ask Claude to write a ShopifyQL query
2. Say **"run it"** or **"execute"** — the `shopifyql-executor` agent takes over
3. Results ≤ 20 rows appear as a table in chat; larger results are saved as CSV to `./shopifyql-results/`

### Running the script directly

```bash
python3.11 scripts/execute_query.py \
  --query "FROM sales SHOW net_sales SINCE 2026-01-01 UNTIL 2026-01-31"

# For _ms duration columns (LCP, INP):
python3.11 scripts/execute_query.py --raw \
  --query "FROM web_performance SHOW lcp_p75_ms GROUP BY day TIMESERIES day SINCE 2026-01-01 UNTIL 2026-01-31"

# CSV output:
python3.11 scripts/execute_query.py --output csv \
  --query "FROM sales SHOW net_sales GROUP BY product_title SINCE 2026-01-01 UNTIL 2026-01-31 ORDER BY net_sales DESC LIMIT 20"
```

### Known SDK quirk

Columns ending in `_ms` (`lcp_p75_ms`, `inp_p75_ms`) trigger a type-cast bug in `query_pandas()`. Use `--raw` for these — the executor agent handles this automatically.

## Installation

### Claude Code

Register the marketplace and install:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add devkindhq/shopifyql-skill
/plugin install shopifyql@shopifyql-skill
```

### Manual

Clone this repo and point Claude Code at it, or copy `skills/shopifyql/SKILL.md` into your own plugin.

## Built by Devkind

This plugin was built and is maintained by **[Devkind](https://devkind.com.au)** — a Melbourne-based development and AI agency specialising in Shopify, custom web applications, and agentic AI systems.

### Agentic reporting for Shopify

Devkind builds agentic reporting pipelines that go beyond standard Shopify Analytics dashboards. Instead of switching between tabs and manually interpreting numbers, an agentic layer does the analytical heavy lifting — pulling data from Shopify, ad platforms, and Google Analytics, then surfacing what changed, why, and what to do next.

If you want automated daily reporting, cross-channel attribution, or a custom AI analytics layer for your Shopify store, Devkind can scope and build it.
